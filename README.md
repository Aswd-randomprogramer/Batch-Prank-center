# Batch-Prank-center
This project is intended to be a place where you will be able to make tons of pranks on your friends computer
There are rules for this to make sure no actual harm is done from the file itself:
1: No destructive commands: No commands, such as deleting System32, or Users, or any deleting, or any other type of destructive commands.
2: No breaking: Please do not add code such as loop start (infinetly starts cmd) or anything like that, which can freeze the system.
3: Pls dont ruin code: While this is an open source project, please do NOT roin others people work.
4: have fun ;) : If you think of a function that isnt against the higher rules, and isnt implemented, go ahead, and implement it :)
